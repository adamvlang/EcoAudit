\section{Results}

The result from the Eco Audit review can be seen below, in figure
\ref{fig:AluFootEny} we can see the contributions for the Aluminium hull
and in figure \ref{fig:CompFootEny} we can see the contributions for the
composite hull.

\section{Analysis}
  When looking at figure \ref{fig:AluFootEny} and \ref{fig:CompFootEny}
  it is clear that the largest contribution towards the $CO_2$ footprint
  and the energy consumption is during the usage phase. For the
  aluminium hull the materials production is $18.5\%$ compared to the
  usage phase contributing to $80.5\%$ of the total. This is analogue
  for the composite hull where the materials stands for about $26.4\%$
  and the usage $72.2$. For the $CO_2$ footprint we can see almost the
  same values for material, $16.5\%$ and $24.5\%$ for aluminium and
  composite respectively. The consumption and footprint during the
  manufacturing phase is negligible in comparison.

  The biggest difference between the two is that for the aluminium there
  is a recyceling possibility that is as large as $75\%$ of the
  materials consumption. This is not the case for the composite hull.
